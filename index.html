        <p> Working out offers a variety of physical and mental benefits that can lead to a higher quality of life. 
            It is important for long-term benefits because it contributes to overall health, reduces the risk of numerous health conditions, 
            and promotes well-being throughout one's lifetime. The positive impact of exercise on both physical and mental health makes it a 
            valuable and sustainable investment in oneself.</p>
        <p> This habit took root decades ago, first with martial art, then with street workout.</p>
